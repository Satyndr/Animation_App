# React Native Animation App

This project is a comprehensive showcase of animation techniques in React Native. Built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), it demonstrates a variety of animation APIs and libraries, including:

- **Animated API** (built-in React Native animations)
- **Reanimated** (react-native-reanimated)
- **Gesture Handler** (react-native-gesture-handler)

The app is organized into sections, each focusing on different animation concepts and practical examples. It is designed as a learning resource and playground for anyone interested in mastering animations in React Native.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
# Clone this Repo
cd Animation_App
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Expo development server

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

You can then run the app on your device using the Expo Go app, or in an emulator/simulator.

## 📱 Features & Structure

- **AnimatedAPI**: Learn the basics of the Animated API, including timing, spring, sequence, and interpolation.
- **Reanimated**: Explore advanced animations, shared values, worklets, keyframes, entry/exit transitions, and more.
- **Gesture Handler**: Combine gestures with animations for interactive UI, including pan, pinch, rotate, and tap gestures.

The app uses file-based routing (see the `app/` directory) for easy navigation between animation demos.

## 📝 Learning Outcomes

- Mastery of React Native's built-in Animated API
- Practical use of react-native-reanimated for performant, declarative animations
- Integration of gesture handling with animations for interactive UIs
- Understanding of animation lifecycles, transitions, and keyframes
